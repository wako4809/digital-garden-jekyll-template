# Hi, I’m Valera! I’m a graphic designer & art director with over 13 years of experience in the creative industry.
Along the way, I’ve worked in in-house roles, started my own projects, developed educational plans, and also co-founded the design agency [ESH](https://eshgruppa.com/) where I work as a managing partner today.

Currently, I focus on [[visual identities]], [[website design]], [[book design]], [[education projects]].
