# Hi, Iâ€™m Valera! Iâ€™m a graphic designer & art director with over 13 years of experience. 

Along the way, Iâ€™ve worked in in-house roles, started my own projects, developed educational plans, and co-founded the design agency [ESH](https://eshgruppa.com/), where I work as a managing partner today.

Currently, I focus on brand identities, book design, website design, and educational projects. Some of my work is available on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/kozhanov), and occasionally, I post on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valera-kozhanov/).

 ðŸ¥¨ I am open to new projects in Germany, the EU, and worldwide. Feel free to contact me via [e-mail](mailto:valera@eshgruppa.com) or [Telegram](https://t.me/wa_koo).
